Nature:
- For my website I wanted to go for a sort of classical newspaper vibe with the serif fonts and neutral colours but I wanted to create a contrast with hints of colour that would pop (especially when interacting with the page). I used the Playfair font from GoogleAPIs as my header font as I deemed it most suitable, providing the crips and sharp lines I was after.

CSS Links:
- All of the pages have links to their own separate CSS files but they all share the same communal CSS file which is the 'General.css' file. This file starts off by dictating the solid black background that runs the edges of the page around the central background image.

Home/About Page:
- The Home/About page summarises the nature of my skills and outlines the direction that I wish for my career to take. At the bottom of the page is a link to my Github as well as a button to download my CV. The Github link (as well as the links on the 'My Projects' page), has a hover title that lets the user know that the link will open in a new tab so they do not have to worry about losing their current spot when browsing through my website.

My Projects Page:
- This page shows brief insights into my projects and the technologies used. This page will grow in time but I thoroughly recommend you please explore the 'Paws 'N' Claws' Javascript game (by clicking on the square) and then review the associated code to understand the depth of my Javascript knowledge. I wanted to style this page with a dynamic flair,e hence the revelation of further details about the project and change in aesthetic when you hover your cursor over each square. I undertook this styling by the use of Javascript on this page (functions for 'onmouseover' and return to default after 'onmouseout'). The links to read each project's Readme and view the code are opened in new tabs by default. Please view the 'myprojectspage.js' file in this repository for further details.

Contact Details Page:
- This page gives the website user the opportunity to send me a direct bespoke message (to discuss work opportunities primarily). I used HTML to create the form and then CSS to create the default styling (width of input fields/size of message box, placeholder indent). I then used Javascript to programme the clicks on the page (when you click on an input field its placeholder temporarily disappears, and a green border is applied to the field, which stays if text is inputted, but vanishes if when you click away you have not put anything in the field). PHP is used to send the message to my email address but it only works if all 3 fields have been filled in (a filter that is passed through and checked by parts of my Javascript code). Please view the 'ContactPage.js' and 'ContactForm.php' files in this repository for further details.
